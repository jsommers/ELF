# ELF: eBPF teLemetry Framework

ELF is a framework for active and passive measurement using the extended
Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF).   The active measurement component can
be invoked (once dependencies are installed -- see `CLOUDLAB.md`) with
`elfprobe.py`.

# Installation

See `CLOUDLAB.md` for installation instructions for an Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04 host.  These instructions were originally designed for our cloudlab experiments, but work for any standard Ubuntu host.
